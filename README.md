### What I learned

This is my second Frontend Master challenge solution - this challenge was similar, but quite a bit more... challenging than the first introductory qr code challenge.

I tried to do something similar to what Kevin Powell did in his video (after watching it a couple of days prior to attempting the solution) - using custom CSS properties, BEM class naming, etc...

Generally, I found it a bit difficult to exactly match my styles to the design (as I am not a pro user). Lots of times I went with the 'best effort', and in the end I'm sort of happy with how it turned out.
